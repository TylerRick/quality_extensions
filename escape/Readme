== Introduction

I only turned this into a gem to make it easier for my code to specify a dependency on it. For those of us used to the ease of use afforded by gems, it's hard to ask users to download and manually install the escape library...

However, it appears that escape.rb now ships standard with newer versions of Ruby, so this gem may not be needed at all any more (unless you have an old version).

(It is available as /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/escape.rb, at least in my version of ruby: ruby 1.8.6 (2007-09-24 patchlevel 111) [x86_64-linux])
