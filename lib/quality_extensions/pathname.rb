# Submit to Facets?::
# Developer notes::
# * Make a patch to actual pathname source.
# * document all Pathname methods better, copying from docs for delegated class if necessary, but NOT just saying 'See FileTest.file?.' How useless that is to have to keep flipping back and forth referring to like 4 different classes!
# History::
# * Renamed parts to split_all to be the same as Facets' File.split_all
# To do:
# path.basename.capitalize doesn't work
# workaround:
# path = Pathname.new(path.basename.to_s.capitalize)
# better:
# path.basename.change_basename {|basename| basename.capitalize} ?
